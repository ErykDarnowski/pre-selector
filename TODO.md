# TODO

- [ ] Select everything by yourself mode (lang / name)
- [ ] Just print in to md file and let user pick and choose
- [ ] Show list of possibilities so people can find new stuff
- [ ] Auto select the lang ones by detecting ext and than add additional ones yourself
  - count amount of each file?
  - check if the script gets all extensions
  - fiugre out the `run` / `artisan` sittuation
  - print ext that couldn't be paired with any hooks
  - blacklist certain extensions / folders (like `.git` / `.expo cache`)?
  - figure out `.spl` / `.add` sittuation (pretty much `.add` is enough to determinte that)
